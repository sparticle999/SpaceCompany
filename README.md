# Overview:
Space Company is a science-fiction incremental game where you start from humble beginnings on Earth, working your way up to travelling between star systems and building Dyson Spheres and pretty much colonizing the entire galaxy(ies?)

Currently, the game is in Beta, which means there is frequent, active development on the game and most bugs from existing features will have been fixed. You should not have to worry about your saves being wiped. However, there will be the occasional bug and I will endeavour to amend these.

# Plans for the Future
- When loading game, the tab you left on is the tab you now start on
- Resources only makeable, not findable
- Meteorite: 4th Tier of machine
- Dark Matter
- Random Events
- Some sort of prestige
- [Change UI from bootstrap to my own]
